"""Router pod node placement on the routing Karpenter NodePool.

The eks-oidc template runs the routing tier (the ingress + auth stack) on a dedicated
Karpenter NodePool whose nodes carry `jupyter-deploy/role=routing` and a matching
`NoSchedule` taint. Placement is enforced by `nodeSelector: jupyter-deploy/role=routing`
plus a toleration injected into the aws-oidc (workspace_router) chart (helm.tf). A router
pod drifting onto the platform MNG or a workspace NodePool is a silent regression the
deployment succeeding would not catch — it co-locates internet-facing ingress/auth pods
with control-loop or user-workspace pods, defeating the tier isolation.

Scope: ALL five router components deployed by the jupyter-k8s-aws-oidc chart —
traefik (ingress), dex (OIDC IdP), oauth2-proxy (auth gate), authmiddleware (workspace
connection auth), and web-app (workspace management UI). Each must land on the routing
NodePool.

Marked `full_deployment` — reads a live cluster (no mutation), requires it to exist.
